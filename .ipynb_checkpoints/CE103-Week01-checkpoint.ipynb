These tools are usefull for solving scientific problems.\n"

    "### Identifiers\n",
    "An identifier is a name given to a variable, function, class or module. Here are the rules that we should know to set an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Can begin with an alphabet (A – Z and a – z and _) and be a combination of lowercase or uppercase or digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Do not start with a digit but can used in anywhere else such as legend1 can allow but 1legend is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Do not use spaces and special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. as identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Identifier can be of any length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords are a list of reserved words that have predefined meaning. Keywords are special vocabulary and cannot be used by programmers as identifiers for variables, functions, constants or with any identifier name. Attempting to use a keyword as an identifier name will cause an error.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable is a named placeholder to hold any type of data which the program can use to assign and modify during the course of execution. In Python, there is no need to declare a variable explicitly by specifying whether the variable is an integer or a float or any other\n",
    "type. To define a new variable in Python, we simply assign a value to a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Variable names can consist of any number of letters, underscores and digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Variable should not start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Python Keywords are not allowed as variable names.\n",
